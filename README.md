================

A little AJAX and templating libary for working with JSON based API's via HTML tags

RA.JS is also a nice AJAX library at its core. Currently providing basic abstraction from standard xhr requests. invocation as `ajax.send({args}, callback);` where {args} is an object of {verb, url, headers, json}. Verb and URL are required.
