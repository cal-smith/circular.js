<h3>ReallyAwesome.JS</h3>
<p>ReallyAwesome.JS is a little library that lets you get JSON formatted results from REST API's using HTML Tags and some fancy attributes.</p>
<p>
	To use simply drop <code><get url="http(s)://url.com"></get> where you want output. all configuration is done through attributes</code>
</p>
<p>
	Currently RA.JS supports
	<ul>
		<li>GET requests</li>
		<li>Basic result templating</li>
		<li>Raw output</li>
		<li>And fireing requests on events</li>
	</ul>
	In the future RA.JS will support
	<ul>
		<li>POST, PUT, DELETE requests and nice features to go along with each</li>
		<li>Better result formatting</li>
		<li>Much better templating support</li>
		<li>Ability to pass results off to functions</li>
	</ul>
	Of course RA.JS is also a nice AJAX library at its core. Currently providing basic abstraction from standard xhr requests. invocation as <code>ajax.send({args}, callback);</code> where {args} is an object of {verb, url, headers, json}. Verb and URL are required.
